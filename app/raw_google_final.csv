• Tying data to key business metrics by analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from multiple sources such as user feedback / surveys, operational data and event streams.
• Regularly reporting outcomes and insights to stakeholders across Relay, including the senior leadership team, providing a clear narrative of the impact on business objectives, thereby influencing future data-driven decision making.

What You'll Bring

• Experience with business intelligence / data visualization tools (Looker, Metabase, Periscope, Mode, etc.)
• Experience with cloud computing (AWS, GCP or Azure) and familiarity with cloud data warehouse platforms (Bigquery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.)

• A successful history of manipulating, processing and extracting value from large datasets and a curiosity for exploratory data analysis
• The ability to execute independently with the input of cross-functional stakeholders
• Adaptability to handle change and uncertainty at times; We are a startup after all!

Our Commitment To You
• Competitive salary and meaningful equity: every team member gets a piece of the pie.
• Comprehensive health benefits: we offer full health benefits + an HSA/WSA starting from day 1 so you get the coverage you need.
• Considerable vacation/end-of-year holiday shutdown: we take time off to reset and recharge so we come back better for our customers.
• Hybrid work environment: we love collaborating and connecting in the office two times a week and offer catered lunches and a snack/beverage program for the days we’re in office. Don’t forget to bring in your furry friends!
• Personal and professional growth: support from leaders who care about your growth and success through regular feedback and coaching. Our goal is to make Relay a step-change career opportunity.
• Top-tier equipment: we’ll make sure you have everything you need to produce your best work.

• Define roadmaps, prioritize features and evangelize product launches to executives, product managers, business development, sales, and other stakeholders at Yelp.

What it takes to succeed:
• Product Management Experience: An understanding of ad technology, including ad measurement or/and ad targeting.
• Tech Savvy: Can work with engineers and data scientists to understand how technical decisions and trade-offs impact your product and users.
• Strong Business Acumen: Track record of building business cases and gaining buy-in for revenue-generating solutions.
• Problem Solver: You can work closely with our Data Science team to drill into problems and identify opportunities, while being comfortable running your own analyses using SQL to dive into key metrics.
• Effective Communicator: Ability to zoom in and zoom out; you can get into the weeds with engineering, and translate features into a vision and roadmap non-technicals stakeholders across the organization are excited by.
• All-Around Leader: You collaborate well with a range of stakeholders and can create a product vision that others want to follow.

What you'll get:
• Compensation range is $95,000-225,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.

"Product Manager, Fraud",Block,Toronto,via Smart Recruiters Jobs,"Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in... front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

The Risk organization builds the strategy, tools, and expertise necessary to enable Square and our Merchants to take principled risks in driving growth and innovation. As a Product Manager, Fraud, you will lead the way in defining and building a strategy for creating innovative experiences for sellers experiencing Fraud. You are customer obsessed, and think of ways to obsess over our Square sellers. You will execute comprehensive Risk solutions that address some of the most challenging and unsolved financial risk problems in today’s environment, as we continue launching new products, expanding into new markets, and supporting our customers. You will be responsible for defining the multi-year product strategy for Square’s Fraud Experience team and driving product initiatives from inception through detailed execution.

Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is a global technology company with a focus on financial services. Made up of Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD, we build tools to help more people access the economy.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.\n\nToday, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.\n\nThere is a massive opportunity in... front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.\n\nJob Description\n\nThe Risk organization builds the strategy, tools, and expertise necessary to enable Square and our Merchants to take principled risks in driving growth and innovation. As a Product Manager, Fraud, you will lead the way in defining and building a strategy for creating innovative experiences for sellers experiencing Fraud. You are customer obsessed, and think of ways to obsess over our Square sellers. You will execute comprehensive Risk solutions that address some of the most challenging and unsolved financial risk problems in today’s environment, as we continue launching new products, expanding into new markets, and supporting our customers. You will be responsible for defining the multi-year product strategy for Square’s Fraud Experience team and driving product initiatives from inception through detailed execution.
