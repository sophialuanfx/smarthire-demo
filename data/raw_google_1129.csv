"Senior Data Engineer, Modeling",Thumbtack,Toronto,via Greenhouse,"About the Data Engineering Team

Thumbtack’s Data Engineering team is a centralized team that works closely with engineers, analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to help design and curate data sets originating from internal and third-party sources to meet current and future needs. Over the next year, it will continue to build on its prior successes in building a more cohesive data warehouse while starting to work more deeply upstream to build data best practices into the full software development lifecycle (SDLC).

About the Role

As a Senior Data Engineer, you will work closely with product and engineering teams throughout Thumbtack, helping turn data into insight into action. The Data Engineering team is a hybrid-embedded team of engineers, some of whom consult directly with product teams to integrate data into the development lifecycle, and others who help build core pipelines and data models for use across the entire company. You’ll work to understand... requirements, then design, deploy, test, and deploy data pipelines and transformations for use by Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Scientists, and Product Managers. Major project areas include: working across product and marketing data teams to build a centralized customer data warehouse, developing advanced ingress/egress validation in the data lake, and modeling cost of supply acquisition for our two-sided marketplace.

Challenge

In 2024, Thumbtack is significantly investing in Data and Data Engineering as a strategic growth area for the company. While there are interesting and difficult challenges across the entire focus area, we’re building on a solid foundation of the modern data stack, are committed to supporting each other, and have internal champions and strong advocates on our partner teams to ensure we succeed. Our primary mandate is to take these core building blocks of a modern data system, and extend them to make simple analysis simple, and deeply complex analysis easier. As a Senior Data Engineer, you will be instrumental in making this happen.

Responsibilities
• Collaboratively refine and evangelize a comprehensive framework for integrating data-thinking into the software development lifecycle for product teams
• Design, build, and maintain core datasets, data marts, and feature stores that support a blend of mature products and features with a rapidly evolving product line, in partnership with analytics, data science, and machine learning
• Integrate with teams consisting of product engineers, analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers throughout the organization to understand their data needs, and help design datasets with the same engineering rigor as any other software we design
• Drive data quality and best practices across key product and business areas

What you’ll need

If you don't think you meet all of the criteria below but still are interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box, and we're looking for someone excited to join the team.
• 5+ years experience designing and building data sets and warehouses
• Hands-on experience with SQL, ETLs, Python, data pipelines, distributed systems
• Ability to understand the needs of and collaborate with stakeholders in other functions, especially Analytics, and identify opportunities for process improvements across teams
• Familiarity building the above with a modern data stack based on a cloud-native data warehouse, in our case we use BigQuery, dbt, and Apache Airflow, but a similar stack is fine
• Strong sense of ownership and pride in your work, from ideation and requirements-gathering to project completion and maintenance

Bonus points if you have
• Domain experience working with data in a relevant area, such as Marketing, Customer Behavior & Engagement, Finance, et al.
• Experience mentoring and coaching engineers
• Experience using and/or configuring Business Intelligence tools (Looker, Tableau, Mode, et al.)
• Experience working with semi-structured or unstructured data in a data lake or similar
• Understanding of database internals and query optimization
